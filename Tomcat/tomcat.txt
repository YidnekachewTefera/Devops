What is Tomcat? 

Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet. 
The Apache Software Foundation has developed it.
It is used widely for hosting Java-based applications on the web.
Tomcat acts as a bridge between web servers and Java-based applications, facilitating the execution of dynamic content and processing client requests.
Tomcat offers a lightweight and efficient solution for hosting Java web applications.
Tomcat is popular for several reasons.
Its scalability is admired by many. Tomcat's robustness is useful. 
It has great community support which brings relief to the users. 
With its modular architecture and adherence to industry standards, Tomcat enables developers to build and deploy web applications with ease.


How Does Tomcat Work? 

Tomcat follows a modular architecture comprising connectors, containers, and the Catalina Servlet container. 
This architecture enables Tomcat to efficiently handle client requests and generate responses.
Connectors are in charge of accepting and processing requests that the clients sent to Tomcat. 
In order to have a connection with the client, different protocols are used by the connectors. 
These connectors can be HTTP or HTTPS. 
They handle tasks like connection management, request parsing, and data transmission.
Once a request is received, connectors pass it to the appropriate container based on the requested URL. 
Containers manage the lifecycle of web applications and execute Java servlets or JSP code to generate responses.
They provide an environment for running web applications, managing resources, and handling concurrent requests.
The Catalina Servlet container, in particular, is responsible for mapping requests to the appropriate servlet and managing the servlet's life cycle. 
It handles the process of generating dynamic content by executing servlet code and producing the response that is sent back to the client.
